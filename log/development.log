DEPRECATION WARNING: Method to_hash is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 5.1, as `ActionController::Parameters` no longer inherits from hash. Using this deprecated behavior exposes potential security problems. If you continue to use this method you may be creating a security vulnerability in your app that can be exploited. Instead, consider using one of these documented methods which are not deprecated: http://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.0.1/classes/ActionController/Parameters.html (called from merge! at /Users/klaudia/development/wdi_project_4_api/app/controllers/authentications_controller.rb:27)

DEPRECATION WARNING: Method to_hash is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 5.1, as `ActionController::Parameters` no longer inherits from hash. Using this deprecated behavior exposes potential security problems. If you continue to use this method you may be creating a security vulnerability in your app that can be exploited.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Method to_hash is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 5.1, as `ActionController::Parameters` no longer inherits from hash. Using this deprecated behavior exposes potential security problems. If you continue to use this method you may be creating a security vulnerability in your app that can be exploited. Instead, consider using one of these documented methods which are not deprecated: http://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.0.1/classes/ActionController/Parameters.html (called from merge! at /Users/klaudia/development/WDI_PROJECT_4_API/app/controllers/rooms_controller.rb:24)

DEPRECATION WARNING: Method to_hash is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 5.1, as `ActionController::Parameters` no longer inherits from hash. Using this deprecated behavior exposes potential security problems. If you continue to use this method you may be creating a security vulnerability in your app that can be exploited. Instead, consider using one of these documented methods which are not deprecated: http://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.0.1/classes/ActionController/Parameters.html (called from merge! at /Users/klaudia/development/WDI_PROJECT_4_API/app/controllers/rooms_controller.rb:30)
